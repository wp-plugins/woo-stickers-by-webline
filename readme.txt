Once check the General configuration -> Enable Sticker On Product Details Page as "YES"

Also check the appropriate settings for e.g problem cause for "NEW Sticker" than go to New Sticker configuration and setEnable Product Sticker as "YES"

If still problem arise override the CSS class to your Theme style which and increase the "z-index" amount.

We have tested plugin in standard themes of WordPress. We found some themes which design is not proper or structured, in that case you have to override specific class to your Theme style and set margin according to that.

= Custom sticker image is repeating. =

We have a standard image dimension is 54 X 54 for custom sticker image. if dimension is below this size problem may occur, in that case you have to override the class "custom_sticker_image" to your own theme style or you can create image according to that size.
